Chapter 2 Project Vision
 The vision of this project ”Cyber-Matrix”, is to integrate several critical security functions into one
 integrated platform, which is designed to revolutionize cyber security management. It brings complex
 security processes such as network scanning and vulnerability assessments into one place and automat
ically achieves organization-oriented simplicity for any company, regardless of size. It is intended to
 empower companies to strengthen their digital defenses easily and thereby improve their ability to better
 protect themselves against the newest cyber threats.
 ”Cyber-Matrix” evolves with an ever-changing nature of digital threats, and the goal is to offer the flex
ible yet dependable security solution- which, in itself, is a real-time analysis of data through an easily
 accessible interface that includes a very supportive chatbot. It’s a method to minimize the risks and
 effects that cyber attacks pose, thus helping to keep safety and trust above everything in today’s business
 world.
 2.1 Problem Domain Overview
 The problem with which our project would be dealing with is the increasing cyber attacks. That is why
 our project, ”Cyber-Matrix” is designed to fully satisfy the needs of cyber security. The system stands
 as a platform that brings together many security functions into one easy-to-use web application. It per
forms several cyber security tasks, such as network scanning, subdomain enumeration, asset discovery,
 and vulnerability assessments. The project aims to automate these processes so that it would ease and
 lighten the management of security in organizations.
 1. Network Scanning: ”Cyber-Matrix” has the feature of advance network scanning and it checks
 open ports and services on those ports. The feature creates a network map and finds possible weak
 points.
 2. Subdomain Enumeration: The system has tools to find subdomains linked to the main domain.
 This is important for spotting parts that may be missed in the security setup but could be used as
 entry points for cyber-attacks.
 3. Asset Enumeration: Asset Enumeration: ”Cyber-Matrix” produces a list of digital assets of the
 organization, providing a clear view of the resources that need protection. Showing organizations
 their complete digital presence.
 4. Vulnerability Assessment: This site scans for security issues in the system at regular intervals.
 It uses current databases of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) to discover risks and
 recommend remedial measures.
Thus, ”Cyber-Matrix” automatically ensures that security operations are accomplished with lesser
 complexity and effectively. The platform is easy to use and simple and requires absolutely no technical
 skills, thanks to the real-time chatbot guiding its users. This design concept ensures that ”Cyber-Matrix”
 is a good fit both for the tiny firm and the giant corporation who wish to secure their online security
 against the increasing risks brought by cybercrime.
 2.2 Problem Statement
 The increasing frequency and complexity of cyber attacks lend an important hand in the need for cy
bersecurity solutions to improve the fight against evolving cyber threats. ”Cyber-Matrix” answers this
 requirement by integrating key security tasks into one easy-to-use, automated platform. Proposed by
 Catalytic Security, the project underlines the urgent need in the industry for strong digital protections
 that can fight modern cyber threats and improve security for organizations.
 2.3 Problem Elaboration
 The cyber security environment is full of complicated and ever-changing issues that organizations have
 to meet in order to defend their digital resources. Some of the most elementary functions include net
work scanning, subdomain enumeration, asset discovery, and vulnerability assessments. Each of these
 activities carries its unique difficulties:
 1. Network Scanning: The process of discovering all live devices and services on a network is very
 time consuming and constantly requires updates to be informed about new vulnerabilities.
 2. Subdomain Enumeration: Identifying all associated subdomains of an organization’s domain is
 crucial to securing its online presence but often overlooked due to the complexity of the task.
 3. Assets Discovery: Maintaining an up-to-date inventory of digital assets is difficult, especially
 with the rapid growth of IoT devices and remote work settings.
 4. Vulnerability Assessments: It must be continually monitored how secure the assets of an orga
nization are to know the vulnerabilities before the attackers do. This is very skill and resource
intensive.
 ”Cyber-Matrix” thus addresses the mentioned cyber-specific problems by automating these processes
 and assembling them into one user-friendly platform. This will make it easy to perform the tasks, and
 it will advance the security measures. Thus, it helps organizations be prepared for any possible threats
 quickly and effectively. The system is designed with a clear understanding of the details of cyber security
 management offering a complete solution meeting the requirements of digital protection today.
 2.4 Goals and Objectives
 The goals and objectives of this project are as following:
 • Performing Sub Domain Enumeration using multiple open-source tools.
 • Performing Network Scanning to collect IPs related to the target and display the open ports along
 with their name.
 • Performing Asset Enumeration.
 • Performing Password and Hash cracking using open-source tools.
 • Generating a comprehensive CVE report.
 • Generating a Network Map to visualize connected devices.
 • Integrating Penetration Testing tools.
 • Integrating a Chatbot for user assistance.
 • Developing an easy-to-use interface, so that the user experience can be enhanced.
 2.5 Project Scope
 Open source tools like gobuster is used in the Cyber-Matrix Project for finding active subdomains and
 removing duplicates. It would find network vulnerabilities based on Nmap scans, with noted significant
 open ports and their IP addresses.
 John the Ripper and Hydra have become quite popular with password cracking for security improve
ment. A weaknesses management automated system will be set up with a special internal tool reporting
 CVEs, featuring AI generated report in order to make security effective.
 This web application would include a lot of features, as mentioned to enhance digital security and iden
tify the vulnerabilities before they are exploited. However, as we will only have a year to complete this
 project, it would not include all the possible checks that should be made to make the digital space safer
 for everyone. Moreover, in the future, we can extend the feature set to include more features related to
 security, as this web app will benefit each and every individual using the internet.
 The project will be developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a web-development
 framework such as React.js. The application will also use Material UI which is an open-source react
 component library. The project will be developed using Agile development principles, and project man
agement will be done using SCRUM methodology. as for the backend, Flask will be used.
 The project deliverables will include:
 • Afunctional web-based application for cyber security firms to manage their digital security.
 • Auser manual for the application
 • Adocumentation of the design, implementation, and testing process
 The project scope does not include the following:
 • Physical security measures
 • Developing mobile applications (iOS or Android)
 • Hardware security
 • Real-time incident response
 • Forensic analysis
 This project scope will be used as a guide throughout the development
