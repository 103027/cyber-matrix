- Implementation of an automated weakness management system that reports CVEs with AI-generated reports.
- Web application development using React.js, Material UI, and Flask backend.
- Agile development with SCRUM methodology.
- Deliverables include a fully functional web-based security application, user manual, and documentation of design, implementation, and testing.

Exclusions:
- Physical security measures.
- Mobile app development (iOS/Android).
- Hardware security.
- Real-time incident response.
- Forensic analysis.

Feature Descriptions and Workflows

1. IP & Ports Lookup
- Purpose: Translate URLs to IP addresses and provide detailed network-related information.
- Process: User inputs URL/IP → Backend runs nslookup → Gathers site info, IPs, DNS names, organization, issuer, common names, robots.txt → Live data fetched on each request → Displayed on frontend.

2. Sub-Domain Enumeration
- Purpose: Identify all subdomains of a domain to discover potential attack points.
- Process: User input parsed → Gobuster tool on Kali Linux runs subdomain scan → Results parsed and shown on frontend.

3. Network Scanning
- Purpose: Detect open, filtered, and closed ports and services.
- Process: User input → Backend runs Nmap → Parses results → Displays port status and services.

4. Asset Enumeration
- Purpose: List digital assets and open ports/services for vulnerability analysis.
- Process: Selective scanning of target URL → Backend enumerates open ports and services → Displays assets and vulnerabilities.

5. Penetration Testing Tools
- SipCalc: Calculates network info (network address, mask, broadcast, host range, etc.) after resolving host with nslookup.
- Nikto: Web vulnerability scanning; runs ~70 seconds → Outputs scanned vulnerabilities → Generates downloadable PDF report.

6. CVE Reporting
- Purpose: Find known vulnerabilities in technologies used by a domain.
- Process: Backend runs whatweb → Identifies tech stack → Queries NVD API for CVEs → Displays CVE IDs, severity → Helps monitor risks.
